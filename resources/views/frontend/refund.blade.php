                Once your request&nbsp;is received and inspected, we will send you
                an email to notify you that we have received your request. We will
                also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a
                credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or
                original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

                If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank
                account again.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time
                before your refund is officially posted.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time
                before a refund is posted.
              </p>
  
              <p>
